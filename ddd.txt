St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.


You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accomp\anied the
commen/cement of an enter-prise which you have regar.ded with such evil
forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my wel“fare and increasing confi-dence in the success
of my undertaking.
